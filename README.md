Using and Enhancing a Static Code Analysis Tool

Objectives

•	To apply a static code analysis tool on a set of software systems to evaluate its effectiveness in detecting bugs.
•	To extend the analysis tool with custom detectors so that application specific bugs can also be defined and detected.

Prior Art

•	There are a set of static code analysis tools available. For this project the findBugs tool will be used. The tool is develeoped as an open source project, which is available at http://findbugs.sourceforge.net.
•	There is an online article on the use of the findBugs tool and how to extend this tool with custom detectors for finding an application-specific bug: 
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-findbug1/


Method

•	As the first step, the tool will be applied to a set of open source projects to evaluate its effectiveness in detecting bugs.
•	In the second step, additional bug definitions and custom detectors for these bugs will be introduced.
•	The extended tool will be compared with respect to the original tool in terms of the number of bugs detected, false positives and false negatives.
•	The Eclipse environment and Java language will be used for development and the enhancement of the findBugs tool.
